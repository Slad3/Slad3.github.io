          The main goal of this project is to provide public visuals for some of
          the side projects and data science that I like to do. Some of my datascience projects are open source, especially the ones that require users to upload personal data.

          Everyone needs have a personal pet project where you can always positively outlet your emotions toward, and this is mine. Also it seems like every developer has a personal website now days so
          what the heck.

          To give you a technical run down of who I am, Iâ€™m a major in Computer
          Science minoring in Math, concentrating in statistics. I plan to
          graduate in May of 2022, however no matter how much you plan, you can
          only weather the chaos of the future, not control it. AKA if I'm
          offered a full time job before graduation, I'll take it into
          consideration.

            Technically 6'4.5", but 6 4 just rolls off the tongue better. Also,
            don't lie about your height; Anyone can literally take a tape
            measure and get an exact objective numerical value of how tall you
            are.

          Favorite language/libraries to work with?

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Even though I tend to favor low level control at the cost of
            convienience, my favorite language to work in is Python, Java coming
            in at a close second. Other than the 'def' keyword, everything just
            makes sense. The library is also support is the gold standard in my
            experience, data science support with python is the best, and most
            complaints about the extremely slow raw perfomence can be overcome
            by knowledge of libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although for some things I tend to perfer Java for the times when I
            want over all general speed, easy packaging, and XML parsing.

          <p>
            Computers just make sense, there's an answer to everything. It isn't
            like plate tectonics or chemestry where the roots to those fields
            are based on postulizing theories. Comparitively, humans have built
            computers from the ground up.

          <p>
            I prefer to do development in Linux, preferably Pop-OS with a KDE
            environment. Though, I do most of my computer tasks on Windows, so I
            end up doing lots of development on both.
          </p>
          <p>
            For programming, I typically gravitate towards a Jetbrain's IDE when
            I can, however I'm growing used to VSCode and doing most of my
            compiling, running, and management from the command line.
