          The main goal of this project is to provide public visuals for some of
          the side projects and data science that I like to do. Some of my
          datascience projects are open source, especially the ones that require
          users to upload personal data.
        </p>

        <p class="introPara">
          Everyone needs have a personal pet project where you can always
          positively outlet your emotions toward, and this is mine. Also it
          seems like every developer has a personal website now days so what the
          heck.

                Technically 6'4.5", but 6 4 just rolls off the tongue better.
                Also, don't lie about your height; Anyone can literally take a
                tape measure and get an exact objective numerical value of how
                tall you are.

              <p>
                I love digging into music whether it's analyzing the
                science/acadamia of music theory, digging into the artistic
                vision and messageing a certain song/album portrays, studying
                the culural impact a certain piece of music has, discovering the
                ways music can psychologically impact humans and control not
                only the way we think but how we feel in a situation, or just
                finding songs that hit my soul.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also absolutely love putting in headphones and going for long
                walks. I don't get why people hate walks, it's cathartic. Plus
                you can walk to a place and get food and not feel guilty about
                yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some other non tech hobbies I enjoy include maps/geography,
                analyzing literature (movies, music, TV Shows, pretty much
                everything except for fiction books), psychology, collecting
                decks of cards from places I've been, driving, and bingeing
                YouTube.

                Tech/STEM related kind hobbies to me include anything related to
                computers or raw science.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest one for me by far is computer science, both software
                and hardware (though I'm more of a software person). I like
                programming, but I love the possibilities and practical
                applications of programming more. From everything from data
                analysis, small scale electronics (raspberry pi/Arduino), to
                frontend and UI developement.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love building computers and everything that goes into building
                and upgrading computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can tell from this site I love everything data science
                from the ability to pull numerical data from anything, to
                transforming that data in a way that we can visualize,
                comprehend, or utilize in a functional manner. This includes
                data visualization, statistical analysis, machine/deep learning,
                etc.
              </p>

                Some other STEM related interets include professional audio
                production, astronomy, some occasional gaming,

              Favorite language/libraries to work with?

            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                Even though I tend to favor low level control at the cost of
                convienience, my favorite language to work in is Python, Java
                coming in at a close second. Other than the 'def' keyword,
                everything just makes sense. The library is also support is the
                gold standard in my experience, data science support with python
                is the best, and most complaints about the extremely slow raw
                perfomence can be overcome by knowledge of libraries like NumPy
                and TensorFlow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although for some things I tend to perfer Java for the times
                when I want over all general speed, easy packaging, and XML
                parsing.
