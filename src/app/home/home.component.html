          Understand the rules, the limitations, edges of the box, then break them.
          We are living inside of pandora’s box, we just don’t know how to let it breathe.
          To claim ignorance on what we rely on in life is arrogant in it’s own right.
          While no one may have all the answers today, I believe that everyone should able to know how to change breaks on a car, cook a balanced 3 course meal for guests, and program a simple script.
          Not everyone can look like Jennifer Aniston or Ryan Reynolds even on a good day, but I believe anyone can look presentable and professional.
          Anyone can learn how to edit semi-professional videos, fix a toilet, learn a second language, download more RAM, and install drywall, it just takes effort and patience.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutIntro">I, Ben Barcaskey, don’t have to reach to achieve uniqueness; it comes naturally.
        It takes effort for me to think inside the box. While I do ok in school, that is certainly not the limit, or even the beginning of my education.
        From being seven years old carrying around books about math and Saturn to being 16 years old giving speeches on how to understand the different parts of a computer, to being 20 years old spending more time on towardsdatascience.com more than on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram combined.

        <h4>Data/Photo Analysist at White House Custom Color</h4>
        <p> I took on a month long internship over winter break building building tools, concepts, and resources for automated analysis on professional photos for White House Custom Color. This includes face and label recognition through AWS Rekognition from images stored in S3 Buckets, creating algorithms for automated cropping, color analysis involving color clusters and product color matching, and focus recognition and mapping the focus of an image. At the end of my internship I presented my work to the management of WHCC.

          Utilized Python with libraries such as OpenCV, SciPy (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib), Scikit-learn, Keras, and Boto (for AWS connectivity). </p>

          <h4 class="question">How tall are you?</h4>
          <p class="answer"> Technically 6'4.5", but 6 4 just rolls off the tongue better.
            Also, don't lie about your height; Anyone can literally take a tape measure and get an exact objective numerical value of how tall you are.</p>

          <h4 class="question">What Software do you use?</h4>
          <p class="answer">I prefer to do development in linux, preferably Pop-os with a kde desktop.
            However I do most of my computer tasks on windows.
            I typically like to gravitate towards a jetbrain's ide when I can. However I'm no stranger to most of the popular ides (and writing/compiling code from a pure text editor).   </p>
