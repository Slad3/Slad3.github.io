          <h4 class="question">How tall are you?</h4>
          <p class="answer"> Technically 6'4.5", but 6 4 just rolls off the tongue better.
            Also, don't lie about your height; Anyone can literally take a tape measure and get an exact objective numerical value of how tall you are.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="question">What Software do you use?</h4>
          <p class="answer">I prefer to do development in linux, preferably Pop-os with a kde desktop.
            However I do most of my computer tasks on windows.
            I typically like to gravitate towards a jetbrain's ide when I can. However I'm no stranger to most of the popular ides (and writing/compiling code from a pure text editor).   </p>
