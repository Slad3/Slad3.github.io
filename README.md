# benbarcaskey.com or whatever I want to call it

Frontend for my personal website, hosted on github pages.

If you didn't look at the repo one bit, the frontend is made in the Angular framework, using Typesript and regular CSS (as opposed to raw javascript and some of the more refined CSS languages). Yeah I could've probably used a simpler and lighterweight solution but this is what I started with, and it works for what I want to do with.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to provide public visuals for some of the side projects and data science that I like to do. For example, one night a couple summers ago I downloaded my Facebook data (granted I haven't used Facebook regularly in years), and decided to parse the search results.

Also it seems like every developer has a personal website now days so what the heck. This is a good way to provide a more self-explanitory resume.
