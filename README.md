# Slad3.github.io / My Personal Site

Front-end for my personal website, hosted on GitHub pages.

## Goals For This Site

The main goal of this site is to be my official portfolio and provide public visuals for some of the side projects and data science that I like to do.

## Technology

The frontend is made with Angular framework, using Typesript and raw CSS.

Also it seems like every developer has a personal website now days so what the heck. This is a good way to provide a more self-explanitory resume.
